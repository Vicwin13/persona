        <h2>A Vision for the Next Two Years</h2>
        <p>As I stand at the precipice of my journey 
            into the world of web development, my vision for the 
            next two years is both ambitious and exhilarating. 
            Currently delving into the intricacies of front-end 
            development, I am excited about expanding my skill set to become a proficient full-stack developer.
            Hereâ€™s where I see myself at the end of these two transformative years</p>
            
            <p>
                In two years, I envision myself as a confident and capable full-stack developer, with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. 
                <br>I envision myself to be:
                <ul>
                    <li> <span>
                        
                        Proficient as a Full-stack Dev:
                    </span>
                    
                    Mastering frontend technologies like React alongside Typescript with testing and backend technologies like Python and add Node.js cause it's in the same javascript family
                    Express and for database, MongoDB. This proficiency will be able to build a complete, end-to-end web apps.     
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>
                        
                        Real-World Project:
                    </span>
                    Gaining substantial practical experience through the development and deployment of real-world projects. Contributing to open-source initiatives and collaborating with other developers will enhance my portfolio and showcase my ability to tackle complex challenges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>
                        
                        Community Engagements:
                    </span>
                    Actively participating in the developer community by attending conferences, engaging in hackathons, and staying updated with the latest trends in web development. This engagement will keep me at the forefront of technology and foster valuable connections within the industry.
